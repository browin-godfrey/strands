This project integrates Agentic AI (using Strands Agents) into our workflow to automatically perform security reviews and threat modelling.



# Agentic AI for Automated Security Review using Strands

This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI** can be used in **Cybersecurity** to automate security reviews and threat analysis of architecture diagrams using the **Strands open-source AI agent SDK**.

Instead of manually performing reviews, this project uses AI agents to:
- Analyze architecture diagrams
- Identify vulnerabilities & threats (STRIDE framework)
- Generate structured security review reports
- Post summaries directly into ticketing systems

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Agent Workflow** using Strands' Swarm capability
- **Security Reviewer Agent** for deep-dive analysis
- **STRIDE Reporter Agent** for structured documentation
- **Image + Text Input** for contextual analysis
- **Customizable Prompts** for different review styles
- **Automated Report Generation**
